Data is available here:

#### Overview
Study consisted of 2 simulations (see *Simulation*) and 3 experiments. 2 of the 3 experiment are reported in the main body of the manuscript and 1 in the supplementary material. <br>
__Name in github repo | Name in paper <br>__
Experiment 1 | Supplementary material <br>
Experiment 2 | Experiment 1 <br>
Experiment 3 | Experiment 2 <br>

To run the code, go to OSF, download the raw data. Store it in the same folder as the code for the respective experiment and run.  <br>

### General comments <br> 
Jupyter lab notebooks of all 3 experiments follow a similar structure. Similarity measures can be found at the top, followed by data preparation, concluded by the analyses that are reported in the manuscript. Detailed attention should be paid to the experimental design as there are small but relevant design differences between the experiments.
